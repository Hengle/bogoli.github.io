In the mornings   
I keep my eyes peeled for cemetery turkeys   
Puffed up and   
Unfathomably large   
Strutting and gobbling like they’re not   
Standing on peoples’ bones.   
I turn my eyes away   
From the dark shapes roaming the graves   
And the sun—a little too bright   
Pierces my head slightly   
And I remember I’m alive.
